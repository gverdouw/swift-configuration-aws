# Swift Configuration for AWS
This package creates a custom provider for the official [Swift Configuration](https://github.com/apple/swift-configuration) package to allow secrets from Secret Manager to be vended. In its current form, this package is not meant to serve as any more than a proof of concept and a discussion starter as we move towards a proper solution.
